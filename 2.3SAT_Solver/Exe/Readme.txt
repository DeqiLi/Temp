SAT60.exe is the 3SAT solver. ---- It is still in development and need to improve.

generator.exe and generator3.exe are two 3SAT instances generators. 
The instances generated by generator.exe probably have no solutions.
The instances generated by generator3.exe (developed by a Japanese) must have solutions(usually there is a unique solution). But the output file need to be modified(delete the head, break the last line into two lines), otherwise the format is not compatible with SAT60.
