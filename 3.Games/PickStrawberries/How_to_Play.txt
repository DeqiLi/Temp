Game Task: 
Starting from an arbitary strawberry as home, you click and pick all strawberries one by one, and then come back home.

You can double-click the current strawberry to go back the previous step.

Your level would increase if you succeed, or stay unchanged if you fail.

If you fail for this time, the game will automatically restart.

You can restart the current game at any time by clicking the button "Restart".

You can start a new game at any time by clicking the button "New Game".


Constraints: 
At each step, you can only pick the strawberries that are directly connected to the current strawberry. You cannot jump over a strawberry.
