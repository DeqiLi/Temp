USA-road-d.NY.gr is one of four original map data files; it is also the smallest file and has 264346 nodes. The biggest one has 24 million nodes.

USA-road-d.NY.gr.preprocessed is the preprocessed file by CH Process algorithm. You can search shortest paths with this file without doing preprocess. 

In the source file, the constant variable "PREPROCESSING=1" means the program preprocesses at first, then test shortest paths searching performance; if set PREPROCESSING=0, then the program directly test shortest paths searching performance without generating preprocessed file first.
